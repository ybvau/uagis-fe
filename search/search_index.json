It is meant to act as a wiki for the software and data analysis components of the job for unmanned airmen to be full-stack in the unmanned aviation field. Overview The docs aim to gover a wide breadth of topics to enable unmanned airmen to be full-stack in the field because of common knowledge. The goal of the project is to encourage seasoned professionals to contribue and help the industry innovate by establishing an enviable uniform knowledge baseline that encourages and enables industry growth and talent development. Currently, the goal is to build a full-stack archive for UA to reference when needed - or at least point them in the right direction. The current scope of the project is as follows: Ground School - The basics UA should know before taking on a geospatial information-related mission. Mission Planning - The general mission planning checklists to be referenced and configured accordingly (and to FAA standards). Software - An overview on the software UA should become acquainted with in order to maintain an enviable track record of missions. Hardware - An overview of existing technology and hardware for different types of data aggregation. Know what needs to be known to do the job right. Support the project! If you feel something should be included in the docs, let me know by submitting a GitHub issue here .

For you it will be a refresher from last semester I like this tutorial because not only does it walk you gently through the software, it also demonstrates what a GIS is capable of. You will work with the different forms of data we discussed in lecture. This is also related to the same content and material I covered in lecture. Lab Instructions Open the Tutorial \u25cf Let\u2019s start by opening the tutorial. https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-pro/ o Note the name for this tutorial may have changed to \u2018Predict Deforestation in the Amazon Rain Forest\u2019 \u25cf With that link open, sign in using your enterprise account login. \u25cf At this point you are asked to download the data from the Get Started with ArcGIS Pro Group. o Click on the link and attempt to download the data into a folder you created in the C:\\ temp folder. o Note: If you cannot do this, I have already downloaded the data for you and placed it into the class data folder. \u25aa T:\\AT319\\AT319ClassData\\GetStartedWithArcPro Arc Pro Note: Make your answers in purple. Also label all screen shots as figures and provide a figure caption. Points will be deducted for any images without a figure label and caption. \u25cf After you open the software, follow the tutorial instructions, but also answer the questions below that related to the section in the tutorial \u25cf Section: Find the study area o What is a basemap? How might different basemaps relate to different ways of examining the data? \u25aa A basemap provides reference information such as national boundaries and water bodies. Different referenced information on a custom basemap may be beneficial to different uses of GIS. o How might the locate function help in UAS mission planning? \u25aa You can navigate to a specific area, down to the street and building number o What types of data are you working with? \u25aa GDB extension database files: specifically Singapore\u2019s Rail Lines, Tourist Stations, and Rail Stations \u25cf Section: Add and Symbolize the Roads layer o What does it mean to Select by Attributes? How does this relate to the definition of a GIS? \u25aa They\u2019re basically specific points of interest. GIS, or Geographic Information System, relies on spatial and geographic data, while this attribute feature ties a description to a geographic location. It also enables users to further tag a point of interest. o How do attributes relate to symbolization? \u25aa Symbols are the icons that enable attributes to be seen o What type of a dataset is the roads layer? \u25aa Streets o Add a screen shot of your selection. \u25aa \u25cf Section: Find Deforestation near existing roadsThe buffer tool creates an offset at a specified distance from the input features. o What is the buffer tool? \u25aa A tool that creates an offset at a specified distance from the input feature. o How might this tool relate to UAS mission planning, or with the types of data UAS can gather? \u25aa It might be useful for planning a path that circles a place of interest, and would be advantageous for when using the gimbal o How might UAS imagery change the detail of analysis done? \u25aa Depending on the methods taken for the UAS to capture the image, the procedure can either go quickly or slowly, and depending on the gimbal angle, there can be side-shots from an aerial POV as well. o Provide some screen shot images of your buffers. \u25cf Section: Predict the impact of the proposed road. o What type of dataset is the Proposed road file? \u25aa Four geodatabases and one raster dataset o When you create Proposed road feature, what type of data are you creating? \u25aa Rasterized dataset \u25cf Section: Digitize the road o When you digitize in the road, are you merely drawing a line on the screen? What makes what you are creating unique? Proposed road feature, what type of data are you creating? \u25aa No- you\u2019re rasterizing the image and connecting the road together by vertices. You\u2019re creating an attribute. o Provide a screen shot of your digitized road \u25cf Section: Finish and Print the map o What elements did you add to your layout to turn this image/drawing into a true map? \u25aa Title and Legend o Why is an inset map important? How are these useful for the geographically large-scale (high detail/small) area data sets that are produced by UAS? \u25aa Shows the geographic location of the area the map is focused on. Useful for reference if an individual does not know where the specific location is. o Place a jpeg of your finished map in this report. \u25cf GIS Concepts review questions: Provide critical thought perspectives on each of the questions below. They are meant to refresh concepts learned in the Fall 309 course. \u25cf What makes data geospatial? That is, what makes the data you worked with today geospatial in nature (think coordinates)? o The data is geospatial due to the geographic spatial ties it has. As it has coordinates and is geographic information, the data itself is geospatial. \u25cf What makes data in a GIS different than a digital map? o GIS is geographic information systems. It\u2019s not only a map - it enables geospatial data to be input and leveraged \u25cf Why is having an understanding of geospatial concepts and geospatial data so fundamental to working with UAS data? o UAS data is reliant on an understanding of geography;without a core competency of geography, someone with UASexperience is simply a pilot and not capable of effectively interpreting the information they set out to capture. \u25cf What are some of the key geospatial concepts and fundamentals that this lab addresses? o GIS use, creating a map, interpreting databases and datasets, a high-level understanding of how to use ArcPro (and other systems assumed to be similar).","title":"ArcGIS Pro"},{"location":"Software/Software%20Overview/","text":"Welcome to Ground School. Ground School covers the basics of UAGIS oeprations. This section serves as a reference doc for how UAS & GIS are so deeply connected. Core components of UAGIS What is \"UAGIS\"? UAGIS stands for \"Unmanned Aerial Geographic Information Systems\"; a hybrid between UAS and GIS with a common goal of providing geospatial information from an aerial perspective. UAGIS are commonly used in the field by aviators and for high-value clients. It's one thing to be a kick-ass pilot; it's another to be the go-to kick-ass pilot because you're full-stack in UAGIS. For that reason, it is imperative to understand the correlation between the two fields, how they overlap, and how they don't. One who specializes in UAGIS may be particularly technologically progressive; there is a significant amount of learning that comes with both successful unmanned systems operations and geographic information systems operations and visiualization. Geographic information is high-demand right now. It always has been, and it likely always will. Surveying comprises XYZ amount of the industry as of ABC.
